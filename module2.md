# Cells

Cells are the building blocks of all living things.

## Differences between animal and plant cells:

* The **shape** of the cell  
	Animal cell is irregular in shape while the plant cell is regular (rectangular)

	Helps maintain the upright _structure_ of the plant.

* **Cell wall**  
	The plant cell contains a cell wall, the animal cell does not.

	Plants don't have skeletal systems. The cell wall is made of cellulose, which is tough and rigid.
	Provides structural support and prevents the cell from over-expanding when it absorbs water.

* **Chloroplast**  
	The plant cell contains an organelle called chloroplast, the animal cell does not.

	Plants make their own food by trapping energy from the sun using the green pigment **chlorophyll** which is contained in chloroplast.

* **Large vacuole**  
	The plant cell contains a large, centrally-located vacuole, animal cells usually have many small vacuoles called vesicles.

	Act as a storage system for harmful substances and waste products. Also helps maintain the pressure inside the cell so the plant can support structures like leaves.


## Common features of plants and animal cells and their functions

| Name | Memorable Phrase | Function |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Cell (Plasma) Membrane | Cell's fortification | Separates and allows communication between the inside of the cell from the outside environment |
| Cytoplasm | Cell's environment | Fluid part enclosed by the membrane. Contains and supports organelles |
| Nucleus | Cell's brain | Contains most of the cell's genetic material, in the form of DNA |
| Endoplasmic Reticulum | Cell's transportation system | Rough ER (has ribosomes attached to it) synthesizes proteins while the Smooth ER transports the proteins made by the ribosomes to where they need to go. |
| Golgi Apparatus | Cell's packaging center | It transports, modifies, and packages proteins and vesicles |
| Mitochondria | Cell's powerplant | Produce energy for the cell - breaks down carbohydrates to form the molecule ATP (energy) |
| Ribosome | Cell's factories | Makes proteins |
| Vacuoles | Cell's compartments | Storage vessels which are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules. They are large in plant cells and small in animal cells (vesicles) |
| Cell Wall | The Cell's reinforcement | It is outside the cell membrane. It is made of a strong substance called cellulose, which provides support, strength and protection for plants and helps plants hold their shape. |
| Chloroplast | Plant cell's chef | Chloroplast makes food for plants. |
| Large Vacuole | Cell's compartments | Enclosed storage vessels which are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules. |

# Movement of Substances in Living Systems

Substances need to get through cell membrane to get into or out of the cell. These include nutrients for the cell the survive and wastes that the cell needs to get rid of.
The membranes are _selectively permeable_ (partially/semi permeable).

Three different processes:
1. Diffusion - Passive Transport
2. Osmosis - Passive Transport
3. Active Transport

## Passive Transport

* Does not require energy to pass through the membrane
* **Facilitated diffusion** occurs when special channels help molecules pass through.
* Transport occurs along a **concentration gradient**.
	* From areas of high concentration to low concentration

### Diffusion

The **net movement** of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the particles are evenly distributed.

Cells obtain requirements:

* Oxygen for respiration
* Carbon dioxide for photosynthesis in plants
* Nutrients such as glucose and amino acids

Get rid of waste:

* Carbon dioxide produced during cellular respiration
* Oxygen produced during photosynthesis

### Osmosis

The movement of water molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration through a semi permeable membrane.

|    | Surrounding solution hypotonic or high concentration | Surrounding solution isotonic or equal concentration | Surrounding solution hypertonic or low concentration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Animal cell** | Net diffusion of water into cell, so cell swells and bursts (_lysis_) | No net diffusion so cell is normal size | Net diffusion of water out of cell so cell shrinks and _crenates_ |
| **Plant cell** | Net diffusion of water into cell, so swells a bit and becomes _turgid_ | No net diffusion so cell is normal size | Net diffusion of water out of cell, so cytoplasm shrinks from cell wall and cell _plasmolyses_ |


## Active Transport

* Requires energy from the cell in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) to facilitate movement through carriers or channels.

* Channels only allow certain molecules through.

* Transport can occur against a concentration gradient.

Examples:

* Plants - Minerals mover from the soil to the roots
* Kidney - Useful substances are reabsorbed from the filtrate into the blood
* Intestines - Some glucose and amino acids are absorbed from the ileum into the blood
