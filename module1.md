# Introduction to Biological Science and the Nature of Life

## What is Biosciences?

* The study of living organisms.

* Includes several branches of science:
	* Microbiology
	* Zoology
	* Botany 
	* Ecology

## Properties of Living Organisms

* Grow
* Reproduce
* Sensitivity/Movement
* Excrete
* Obtain Nutrition
* Respire
* Made up of cells

### Complex Organization

* Composed of one or more **cells**
* A **tissue** is a series of cells that accomplish a shared function
* Tissues form **organs**
* A number of organs working together compose an **organ system**
* An **organism** is a complex series of various organ systems

### Responsiveness

All living things are able to respond to stimuli in the external environment.

* An organism must coordinate its responses:
	* System of nerves
	* Number of chemical regulators - hormones

* Number of effectors -  muscles and glands

* Energy is generally used in the process

Organisms change their behavior in response to changes in the surrounding environment. The behavior is active not passive.


### Nutrition

Living things take in materials from their surroundings, for growth or to provide energy. The breakdown of organic compounds such as glucose provides the energy for survival.

> Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain energy and raw materials from nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats.

Animals are **heterotrophic**, they gain organic compounds from their food.

Plants are **autotrophic**, they absorb nutrients from the air and soil for **photosynthesis** to make their own food.


### Growth

An organism takes in material from the environment and organizes it into its own structures. The organism must expend some of the energy it acquires during **metabolism**.


### Reproduction

A living thing produces copies of itself by this process. It can be an extension of the growth process.

**Asexual** reproduction involves only one parent and results in genetically identical cells.

**Sexual reproduction** occurs in more complex organisms.
Two parents contribute to the formation of a new individual with a new combination of traits.


### Respiration

The process of converting glucose into energy useable for life processes. 

_Involves_ breathing.

1. **Aerobic**:  
	Occurs in the presence of oxygen
	* activity for a prolonged period of time
	* energy is provided by oxygen (constant supply)
	* Glucose + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water

2. **Anaerobic**:  
	Occurs in the absence of oxygen
	* Glucose -> Alcohol + Energy
	* Glucose -> Lactic Acid + Energy

	* Used for short bursts (max of about 60 seconds)
	* Accumulate an **Oxygen Debt**. Requires breathing deeply and heavily after the activity.

### EXcretion

Wastes are the result of chemical reactions that occur within cells.

Examples:
* Lungs -> Carbon dioxide and water vapour
* Liver -> Bile
* Kidney -> Urine
* Skin -> Sweat

In plants, excretion occurs in the **stomata** of the leaves and **lenticels** of the stems.

## Plants versus Animals

| Plants | Animals |
| --- | --- |
| Rooted in one place and do not move on their own | Ability to move fairly freely |
| Contain chlorophyll | Do not contain chlorophyll |
| Make their own food (Autotrophic) | Cannot make their own food and are dependent on plants and other animals for food (Heterotrophic) | 
| Give off oxygen and take in carbon dioxide given off by animals | Give off carbon dioxide which plants need to make food and take in oxygen which they need to breathe |
| Plant cells have cell walls and other structures that differ from those of animals | Animal cells do not have cell walls and have different structures than plant cells | 
| Either no or very basic ability to sense | Highly developed sensory and nervous system |
| Growth is not restricted by time limit | Growth occurs only for a definite period of time | 
| Excrete their waste in the form of vapour, gum, sap, resins, etc | Excrete their waste in the form of urea, uric acid, ammonia, etc. |
